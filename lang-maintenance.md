# Procedures for creating and maintaining the language pages

Note: "speaking" includes signing.

## Choices for each test page

* Language â€” Something that speakers or linguists identify as a distinct language. These instructions call it the "target language."
* Country â€” A country associated with the target language.
* Locale â€” The locale could be the same as the country. Or it could be a region that's associated with the target language within the country. (Example: Some people speak Lower Sorbian in the city of [Cottbus, Germany](lang/dsb.html).)
* Script (optional) â€” An alternate writing system.

In the test results, record how the target language and additional language(s) were chosen.

## List of links: Web pages in the target language

Include a government webpage in the target language. In order of preference:

1. A federal government webpage
1. A local government webpage
1. "ðŸ™… Government": indicate that we couldn't find any suitable page 

Google Translate:

1. Try https://translate.google.com/?hl=xx substituting the two- or three-character code for the target language.
1. For the link text, use Google's own localized name for the Google Translate page.
1. If Google supports translation in the target language, but the Google Translate page itself is not localized in the target language, then link to the Google Translate page localized in the national language for the country. Note the national language as "<code>(xx)</code>" after the link.
1. "ðŸ™… Google Translate" (this string not translated, and not marked up as <code>lang="en"</code>) â€” if Google does not support translation in the target language.

WCAG:

1. Find a translation on the [WCAG 2 Translations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/translations/) page. Note the version number.
1. If the latest version of WCAG does not have an "authorized" translation, continue with the following steps.
1. Translate the words "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines" into the target language, and search for this string. If an unofficial translation exists,
1. Note the 

Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR):


## List of links: Web pages in another language

1. A federal government webpage in a language that's more common for this country
1. A federal government webpage in a language that's less common for this country
1. A local government webpage in a language that's less common for this country
1. "ðŸ™… Government": indicate that we couldn't find any suitable page 

## How to find pages
