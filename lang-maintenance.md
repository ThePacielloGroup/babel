# Procedures for creating and maintaining the language pages

Note: "speaking" includes signing.

## Choices for each test page

* Language â€” Something that speakers or linguists identify as a distinct language. These instructions call it the "target language."
* Country â€” A country associated with the target language.
* Locale â€” The locale could be the same as the country. Or it could be a region that's associated with the target language within the country. (Example: Some people speak Lower Sorbian in the city of [Cottbus, Germany](lang/dsb.html).)
* Script (optional) â€” An alternate writing system.
* Language code: Usually just the two- or three-character IANA language code. We don't add the country, locale, or script unless it's important to distinguish the form of the target language.

## Adding a page

* Copy a stub language page the template HTML. Name the file with the language code.
* Add it to the [list of language pages](lang-pages.md).
* Copy a stub results page from the template HTML. Name the file with the language code.
* Add it to the [list of test results](research/lang-results.md).
* In the individual results page, fill the "Creating the test page" section as you go.

## Navigation

* Copy the flag icon character from [Emoji flags (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_indicator_symbol#Emoji_flag_sequences).
* Alphabetize it by flag code, link language, and URL language â€” in other words, alphabetize the lines of HTML code in the list. Mainly this groups languages by country.

## Table of opening hours

* Confirm the week starts on Monday in this country. Example: [Calendar for Year 2024 (Antigua and Barbuda) - TimeAndDate](https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/?year=2024&country=221)


## List of links: Web pages in the target language

Wikipedia:

1. Find the article in a dominant language.
1. Use the language selector to change to the target language.
1. Use the name of "Wikipedia" and the article title as Wikipedia spells them.

Include a government webpage in the target language. In order of preference:

1. A federal government webpage
1. A local government webpage
1. "ðŸ™… Government" (translated into the target language): indicate that we couldn't find any suitable page 

Google Translate:

1. Try https://translate.google.com/?hl=xx substituting the language code.
1. For the link text, use Google's own localized name for the Google Translate page.
1. If Google supports translation in the target language, but the Google Translate page itself is not localized in the target language, then link to the Google Translate page localized in the national language for the country. Note the national language as "<code>(xx)</code>" after the link.
1. "ðŸ™… Google Translate": indicate that Google does not support translation in the target language. In this context, do not translate this phrase and do not give it a <code>lang</code> attribute.

WCAG:

1. Find a translation on the [WCAG 2 Translations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/translations/) page. Note the WCAG version number (2.0, 2.1, 2.2).
1. If the latest version of WCAG does not have an "authorized" translation, continue with the following steps.
1. Translate the words "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines" into the target language, and search for this string. If an unofficial translation exists, link to it.
1. If no translation was found of the latest version, list it with "ðŸ™… WCAG 2.2 ([LANGUAGE CODE])".

## List of links: Web pages in another language

Include a government webpage in another language. In order of preference:

1. A federal government webpage in a language that's more common for this country
1. A federal government webpage in a language that's less common for this country
1. A local government webpage in a language that's less common for this country
1. "ðŸ™… Government <code>(xx)</code>": one or two instances, indicating that we couldn't find any suitable page in this other language(s). Translate "Government" into the other language(s).

WCAG:

* If there is a language that's more common for this country:
    * If it has WCAG 2.2, link to it; otherwise "ðŸ™… WCAG 2.2 ([LANGUAGE CODE])".
    * If it has an older version of WCAG, link to it; followed by "ðŸ™… WCAG 2.2 ([LANGUAGE CODE])".
* Finally (unless the English link is already included above), always include the English link. Even if WCAG 2.2 is available in the country's languages, this extra link is still useful just to test the English link phrase.

## Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)

1. In the [UDHR search page](https://www.ohchr.org/en/search?f%5B0%5D=event_type_taxonomy_term_name%3AUniversal%20Declaration%20of%20Human%20Rights), under "UDHR Translations" enter the name of the language.
1. If necessary, use Wikipedia articles to find synonyms and glossonyms for the name of the language, then search again in UDHR.
1. For the title of the document, the "Article 2" section heading, and the two paragraphs of Article 2, use the UN text.

### UDHR in other language

Both of these:

* UDHR in another language or two for this country
* If there is a language worth translating, but it's not available at UN, then "ðŸ™…"
* UDHR in French
