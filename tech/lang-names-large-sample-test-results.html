        <p>Test page: <a href="lang-names-large-sample.html">Language names, large sample</a></p>

        <p>Observations 2025-01-07: Of the combos tested today, only JAWS announces language names. "Known" examples are e.g. English, Spanish, German; while Lower Serbian (dsb) is not known. Which languages are "known" varies by screen reader, that's part of what we're exploring here.</p>

        <p>Windows 10, JAWS, Chrome:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Known language, with voice available: Announces digits in this language. Example: "veinte" for Spanish (es).</li>
            <li>Known language, without voice available: Announces the language name, then the digits in English. Example: "Croatian, twenty-seven" (hr).</li>
            <li>Unknown language: Announces digits in English (the language of the page).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Android TalkBack + Chrome:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Known language: Announces digits in this language.</li>
            <li>Unknown language: Announces digits in the most recent language touched.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Android TalkBack + Chrome:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Announces all digits in English (the language of the page), for both known and unknown languages.</li>
        </ul>
